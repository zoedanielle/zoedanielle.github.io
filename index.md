### Hand Waves and Smiles

Hi, my name is Zoe Stearns. I am human researcher, cognitive scientist, and PhD candidate specializing in oculomotor behavior and visual perception.

My website is your portal to thought-provoking discussions based on visual perception research, along with personal insights on philosophy, neuroscience, yoga, biological intelligence, and so much more. My ultimate mission? Empower humans to discover their full potential within the mind-body relation.

Let's embark on this journey together!

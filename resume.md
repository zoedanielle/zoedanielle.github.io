## Currently

Zoe Stearns is currently pursuing a PhD in Brain and Cognitive Science at the University of Rochester. As a graduate research trainee in the Active Perception Lab, she explores how eye movement behavior affects perceptual experience, neural encoding, and cognition.

Over the past 5+ years, Zoe has utilized advanced in-lab technologies, incorporating high-precision eye-tracking technology and custom gaze-contingent software. These tools enable her to accurately pinpoint the center of gaze for human observers. The technical resources at the Active Perception Lab have empowered her to investigate the impact of oculomotor movements and attention on the perception of fine spatial details within the central fovea.

Zoe's PhD research illuminates the pivotal role of oculomotor and attentional factors in shaping our perception. By unraveling the mechanisms governing visual perception, especially the close interplay between motor control, attention, and foveal sensitivity, her graduate work offers insights into how our sensorimotor behavior actively influences and molds our real-time perceptual experience. She sheds light on the intricate relationship between our eyes, brain, and environment, providing evidence for the dynamic spatiotemporal nature of vision that underlies our everyday perception of the world.
